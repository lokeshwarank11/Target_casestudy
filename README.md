# Target Brazil Operations: Insights and Recommendations

## Introduction to Business Case
Target, a leading global retailer, operates in Brazil with a focus on analyzing 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. This dataset provides comprehensive insights into various dimensions such as order status, pricing, payment and shipping performance, customer demographics, product attributes, and customer reviews.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset is comprised of 8 CSV files:
- customers.csv
- sellers.csv
- order_items.csv
- geolocation.csv
- payments.csv
- reviews.csv
- orders.csv
- products.csv

These files collectively offer a detailed view of Target's operations in Brazil, facilitating analysis of order processing, pricing strategies, payment efficiency, shipping logistics, customer behavior, product characteristics, and customer satisfaction levels.

## Tools and Databases Used
- Google BigQuery was utilized for data analysis.

## Insights and Business Recommendations
1. **Order Management**
   - Approximately 1.2% of orders (609 unavailable + 625 canceled) were problematic. Further analysis should focus on understanding reasons behind order cancellations and unavailability to minimize these issues.

2. **Workforce Optimization**
   - There's a noticeable spike in order volume within short periods. Target should consider hiring temporary or contractual employees during peak times to manage workload effectively and mitigate operational risks.

3. **Staffing Adjustments**
   - Analysis indicates higher customer activity in the afternoon and night. Adjusting staffing levels to peak hours could enhance customer service efficiency and satisfaction, potentially reallocating resources from slower periods like mornings and dawn.

4. **Market Focus**
   - Concentration of orders from only 3 states suggests potential for expanding business in other states. Target should develop strategies to improve market penetration and customer acquisition in underperforming regions.

5. **Delivery Efficiency**
   - States with low order volumes also exhibit longer average delivery times. Target should investigate reasons contributing to low order volumes, such as logistical challenges, and implement solutions to streamline delivery processes and improve service levels.
